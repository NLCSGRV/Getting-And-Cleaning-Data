## Course Project

The purpose of this project of the Getting And Cleaning Data course on Coursera is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The data used for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and are the result of experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers who performed six activities while wearing a smartphone on their waist. 

Further details of the dataset and the processing carried out on it can be found in the [Codebook](https://github.com/NLCSGRV/Getting-And-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/CODEBOOK.md). The code is provided in a single [R file](https://github.com/NLCSGRV/Getting-And-Cleaning-Data/blob/master/run_analysis.R). This code will download the required data files and load/install the necessary packages.
